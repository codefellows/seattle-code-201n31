      <h2>Article Element</h2>
      <p>The <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.</p>

      <h2>CSS Border Property</h2>
      <p>The border is drawn between the margin and the padding of a box. If you are using the standard box model, the size of the border is added to the width and height of the content box. If you are using the alternative box model then the size of the border makes the content box smaller as it takes up some of that available width and height of the element box. For styling borders, there are a large number of properties â€” there are four borders, and each border has a style, width, and color that we might want to manipulate. You can set the width, style, or color of all four borders at once using the border property.</p>

      <h2>Margin and Padding Properties</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>When one value is specified, it applies the same margin to all four sides</li>
        <li>When two values are specified, the first margin applies to the top and bottom, the second to the left and right</li>
        <li>When three values are specified, the first margin applies to the top, the second to the right and left, the third to the bottom</li>
        <li>When four values are specified, the margins apply to the top, right, bottom, and left in that order (clockwise)</li>

      <h2>Block and Inline Elements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.</li>
        <li>A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</li>
        <li>An inline element does not start on a new line.</li>
        <li>An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.</li>
        <li>The display CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline element and the layout used for its children, such as flow layout, grid or flex.</li>
      </ul>
